Yesterday:
Worked on ticket 1983987 - [Digital WIC] 

APIM Endpoints for Orders Pricing Service.

Completed the setup of PriceCart and PriceMultiCart endpoints for the APIM project. 

Also, the PR for ticket 1983974 â€“ [Digital WIC] 
Create Front Door for Pricing Service in Orders Infra 
was merged.

Today:
Continuing work on ticket 1983987, 
currently finalizing the PriceMultiCart endpoint. 

Need to generate the spec files for both PriceCart and PriceMultiCart from the Order Pricing Service API. 
Didn't raise the PR yesterday due to some uncertainties, but have now clarified them. 

Plan to finalize and raise the PR by end of day.
